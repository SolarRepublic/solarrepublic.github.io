		Welcome to the <strong>Solar Republic, LLC</strong> (“Solar Republic”) Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use any information you submit when using the Interface, as defined within the Solar Republic <a href="./terms-of-service.html">User Terms of Service</a> (“User Terms”). This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the User Terms and is integrated into the User Terms. All capitalized proper nouns not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the same definitions and meanings as defined by the User Terms. Please review the Privacy Policy periodically as we may revise it from time to time. If you do not agree with or accept our Privacy Policy in its entirety, you must not access or use the Interface.

		At Solar Republic, we may collect the following information from you when you access or use the Interface:

		The above information is automatically logged to our servers when you use the Interface to interact with Blockchain Technology. Per our internal policy, the above information will be automatically and routinely deleted from our servers every 6 to 12 hours unless we are compelled by law to retain the information.

	<p>
		Any information that exists within the contents of network requests sent to our servers, including but not limited to public addresses, public keys, public account balances, public transaction memos, and all other data contained within the submitted transactions or queries associated with Blockchain Technology may be forwarded to third party providers in order to process the requests.
		Forwarded network requests omit the IP address of the sender in order to prevent third parties from collecting users IP addresses. However, third parties may collect and retain any other metadata submitted with network requests including but not limited to HTTP headers. Users must understand and accept these risks prior to using the Interface.
	</p>

	</p>


	<h2>8. Security Measures</h2>

	<p>
		We make reasonable attempts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards such as encryption. However, as the Interface relies on Blockchain Technology and electronic infrastructure that we have no control over, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information submitted.
