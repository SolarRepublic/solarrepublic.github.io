Additionally, we may revoke your access or license to our Interface if we believe that your actions may harm us, our business interests, or any third party rights. Failure by us to revoke your access does not act as a waiver of your conduct. Nothing in this Agreement obligates us to provide you any access or license to use the Interface.
	</p>


	<h2>
		7. Digital Wallet and Interface
	</h2>

	<p>
		In order to access the Blockchain Technology through the Interface you may be required to connect a digital wallet that is hosted by you or a third party ("Digital Wallet") that contains digital assets ("Digital Assets") legally owned by you. You are solely responsible for any transactions or transmissions that occur with your Digital Wallet.

		All Digital Wallets created or used are non-custodial, meaning that you control all private and public keys associated with the Digital Wallet and Solar Republic never has control or possession of your Digital Wallet to facilitate any transactions made.

		You agree to notify Solar Republic immediately of any unauthorized use or other breach of security of your Digital Wallet. Solar Republic will not be liable for any losses you incur as a result of someone else using your Digital Wallet. 

		Use of the Interface, in particular for transactions involving Digital Assets, are highly volatile, experimental, and may carry financial risk. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. We accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Interface for performing Digital Asset transactions using your Digital Wallet. Solar Republic reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending digital transaction as required by law, at our discretion, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order, or to enforce transaction limits. Please be aware that once a transaction is initiated via your Digital Wallet, Solar Republic may not reverse such transaction, your Digital Wallet is solely controlled by you and we cannot access or control your Digital Wallet in any manner, you are solely liable for maintaining access to your Digital Wallet. For any transactions initiated using the Interface, the Blockchain Technology may collect fees where applicable, whether or not such transaction is successful. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your own Digital Wallet to store or transact any non-supported Digital Assets. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT ANY NON-SUPPORTED DIGITAL ASSET MAY BE LOST IF YOU ATTEMPT TO STORE SUCH DIGITAL ASSET IN YOUR DIGITAL WALLET. SOLAR REPUBLIC ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ATTEMPT TO USE OR STORE ANY DIGITAL ASSETS AND YOU RELEASE SOLAR REPUBLIC FROM ANY LIABILITY AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY TRANSACTIONS REGARDING YOUR DIGITAL WALLET
	</p>


	<h2>
		8. No Professional Advice or Fiduciary Duties
	</h2>

	<p>
		All information accessible through the Interface is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment, tax, or legal advice. You should not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any information contained within the Interface or any other information that we make available at any time, including, without limitation, blog posts, articles, links to third-party content, discord content, news feeds, tutorials, tweets, and videos. 

		Before you make any financial, legal, or other decisions involving the Interface, you should seek independent professional advice from an individual who is licensed and qualified in the area for which such advice would be appropriate.
	
		We are not your broker, intermediary, agent or advisor and have no fiduciary relationship or obligation with you when you use the Interface. We have no liability for any of your activities or decisions made while using the Interface. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.
	</p>


	<h2>
		9. Transaction Timing and Information
	</h2>

	<p>
		The Interface attempts to provide up to date information for all Digital Assets listed; however, due to the nature of Digital Assets some information may be out of date or inaccurate. As you control your own Digital Wallet you are solely responsible for verifying any information regarding the Digital Assets and the Interface. 
		No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any information distributed via the Interface or otherwise encountered when using the Interface. 
		 We are not liable to you for any inaccurately quoted information including but not limited to Digital Asset rates or pricing rates for any Digital Assets. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Our Interface cannot control the timing of any transactions, transaction times are based on your Digital Assets and the Blockchain Technology selected, and we are not liable or responsible for any delays or any issues due to untimeliness of any transactions initiated through the Interface. Use of the Interface is at your sole risk and liability.
	</p>


	<h2>
		10. Interface and Blockchain Technology
	</h2>

	<p>
		The Interface contains developed protocols built through open source smart contracts and subject to the operating procedures of any underlying Blockchain Technology. Your use and access to the Blockchain Technology through the Interface is at your sole risk and liability. You understand that both the Blockchain Technology and the Interface remain under development, which creates technological, trading, and other risks when using the Interface. These risks include, but are not limited to, delays or losses in trades, withdrawals, and Digital Assets. You agree that these risks may materially impact your transactions while using the Interface, which could result in the loss of the transaction or a complete loss of your Digital Assets. As the Interface and Blockchain Technology are constantly under development we cannot guarantee or otherwise ensure full security, fidelity, operation, accuracy, or completeness of any services offered. You acknowledge that the Interface and the Blockchain Technology are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided in both, and you represent and warrant that you have the skill and ability to evaluate and understand the risks of using both the Blockchain Technology and the Interface. You are solely responsible for any interactions that you may undertake using the Interface to interact with the Blockchain Technology.
	</p>


	<h2>
		 11. Blockchain Technology
	</h2>

	<p>
		Please be aware that the underlying technology that makes blockchain based networks, cryptographic systems, and smart contracts available (collectively "Blockchain Technology") 
		is open source and can be used, copied, modified, and distributed by third parties.
		
		Solar Republic does not control or operate the Blockchain Technology, and we assume no responsibility for the operation, functionality, or security of the Blockchain Technology. Blockchain Technology is subject to change that is out of our control, which could materially affect the Interface, and the value, functionality, availability, and use of any Digital Assets.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is your responsibility to make yourself aware of upcoming operating changes, and you must carefully consider publicly available information in determining whether to continue to use the Interface, transact with any Blockchain Technology using your Digital Assets, or otherwise interact with the Blockchain Technology through the Interface. 
		
		Blockchain Technology is currently under development, and this creates uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions through the Interface.

		You acknowledge and accept the risks of using your Digital Assets with our Interface that relies on Blockchain Technology and agree that Solar Republic is not responsible for any changes to any Blockchain Technology that may cause you to experience a complete loss of value or access to your Digital Assets.
		
		Such changes may include, but are not limited, to forks, rollbacks, changes to operating rules, breaches of security, and outages.
	</p>


	<h2>
		 12. Fees and Costs
	</h2>

	<p>
		Where you use the Interface, you may be required to pay a fee where necessary, including but not limited to any third party fees. You are solely responsible for paying all fees, and we are not liable to you for any delays in any transactions where you have failed to pay any fees. Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimate of fees. Such fees may vary from the actual fees that you pay to use the Interface and/or the gas fees required for your Digital Assets.
	</p>


	<h2>
		13. Gas
	</h2>

	<p>
		Any transaction involving the Digital Assets through the Interface is only completed upon confirmation through the Blockchain Technology, and we are not liable for any incomplete transactions or delays. You shall be required to maintain an adequate amount of Digital Assets to consume as gas ("Gas") within your Digital Wallet to process any requested transactions. Where you fail to maintain adequate Gas amounts you understand that you will be unable to partake in any transactions using your Digital Wallet. We shall not be responsible for any delay in any transactions due to inadequate Gas within your Digital Wallet. Please be aware that any Gas used cannot be returned and all Gas consumption or charges are subject to the Blockchain Technology.
	</p>


	<h2>
		14. Reversals
	</h2>

	<p>
		Due to the nature of Blockchain Technology you understand and agree that using the Interface may be irreversible and you solely undertake this risk when using the Interface. As we do not control your Digital Wallet, we cannot reverse any transactions that occur using your Digital Wallet. 
	</p>


	<h2>
		15. Interface Availability and Modification
	</h2>

	<p>
		We do not guarantee that the Interface will always be available, work, or be accessible at any particular time.

You agree and acknowledge that the Interface uses remote access and may not always be either 100% reliable or available. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We reserve the right to alter, modify, update, or remove the Interface or any portions thereof, at any time at our discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue previously offered features or functionality at our sole discretion and without prior notice. We are not liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any feature or component of any portion of the Interface. We reserve the right to determine the timing and content of software updates, which may be automatically updated without notice to you. We may conduct such modifications to our Interface for security, intellectual property, legal reasons, or various other reasons at our discretion, and we are not required to explain such modifications or provide you access to previous versions of our Interface. Nothing in this section obligates us to take measures to update the Interface for security, legal, or other purposes.

	<h2>
		22. Assumption of Risk
	</h2>

	<p>
		Transacting Digital Assets or using Blockchain Technology involves significant risks and potential for financial losses which may result in the theft or loss of some or all of your Digital Assets. Such risks include without limitation the following: 
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			the Digital Assets and the Blockchain Technology are constantly under development making your Digital Assets vulnerable to hacking, breaches in security, flaws, errors, bugs, failures, loss, theft, and fraud (whether due to Solar Republic or otherwise); 
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Assets may fail to operate, lose all value, or be changed in a manner including without limitation a fork or rollback of the underlying Blockchain Technology; 
		</li>
		<li>
			the Digital Assets may decrease in value or lose all of its value due to various factors including discovery of wrongful conduct, market manipulation, changes to the underlying Digital Asset or Blockchain Technology. Such factors could cause transaction costs to increase which may impact your use of the Interface; 
		</li>
		<li>
			suspension or cessation of support for a Digital Assets by Blockchain Technology service providers may result in a total loss or inability to transfer or access any Digital Assets; and 
		</li>
		<li>
			Digital Assets may lose value or functionality due to governmental action, laws, or regulation as there is uncertainty to the legal status and categorization of Digital Assets. Such actions could result in the loss of access to the Interface. 
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You hereby assume and agree that Solar Republic will have no responsibility or liability for such risks. You hereby irrevocably waive, release, and discharge any and all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Solar Republic, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, and representatives related to any of the risks set forth herein. You accept the risk of all use of the Digital Assets and are responsible for conducting your own independent analysis of the risks specific to the Digital Assets.

		23. Limitation of Liability
	</h2>

In jurisdictions that allow a limitation on liability, you agree that our liability is no more than the amount you paid in the past six months in any fees (excluding Gas) to access the Interface or one-hundred US dollars (USD$100.00), whichever is greater. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Solar Republic and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages. So, the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you, and you may also have other legal rights that vary between jurisdictions. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, we do not disclaim liability for: (a) personal injury caused by Solar Republic's negligence or that of any of its officers, employees, contractors, or agents; (b) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.

	<h2>
		27. Choice of Law
	</h2>

	<p>
		This Agreement shall be governed by the laws in force in the state of Washington. 
	</p>


	<h2>
		28. Arbitration
	</h2>

	<p>
		Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Solar Republic and limits how you can seek relief from Solar Republic. Also, Solar Republic arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You and Solar Republic agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement ("Dispute"), including, but not limited to, the validity, construction, and performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by and under the laws of the state of Washington, without giving effect to conflict of laws principles thereof. 
	</p>

	<h3>
		28.1 Informal Resolution
	</h3>

	<p>
		For any dispute or claim that you have against Solar Republic, before seeking mediation, arbitration, or any other form of legal relief, you agree to first contact Solar Republic and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to Solar Republic by email at legal@starshell.net. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our Notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. 
		
		Where we receive or send such a Notice, you and Solar Republic shall attempt in good faith to resolve such claims in an informal manner. The parties agree to maintain the confidential nature of all disputes and disagreements between them, including, but not limited to, informal negotiations, mediation or arbitration, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct these dispute resolution procedures or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. 
	</p>

	<h3>
		28.2 Binding Arbitration
	</h3>

	<p>
		If you and Solar Republic cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration 
		administered by JAMS ("Binding Arbitration" or "Arbitration").
		 If there is a dispute about whether this arbitration provision can be enforced or applies to the Dispute, you and Solar Republic agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue. However, 
		any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
	</p>

	<p>
		You and Solar Republic agree that arbitration under this Agreement will substantially and procedurally be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;1, et seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS before one (1) arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Vancouver, WA in English, under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules may be found at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com">https://www.jamsadr.com/</a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The location of the arbitration shall be Vancouver, WA or a location agreed upon by the parties. Where a Dispute does not exceed $15,000 such Dispute shall be arbitrated solely via pleadings and documents. 
		
		Both parties agree that they shall solely be responsible for paying for any fees related to any arbitration resolution.
	</p>

	<p>

In any case in which: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable as to any Disputes, the class, collective, and/or representative action on such Disputes must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the Class Action Waiver shall be enforced in arbitration on an individual basis as to all other Claims to the fullest extent possible.
